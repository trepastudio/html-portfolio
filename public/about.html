<h1>About BZB</h1>
<p>I rely on the idea that our emotions are present anytime and everywhere, even in Design (that wants so badly to be neutral and rational). I work with emotional design, as I am myself an emotional designer. </p>

<p>I like explosions of color, as much as I like the quiet of the black and white grid. I like unreadable fonts with outrageous inktraps as much as I appreciate Futura, Times or Helvetica. 
I struggled for years to find a voice that would represent this. It was only when I got in touch with my emotions that I found a way. So I decided to honour that, and create a visual brand around my own emotions, my busy bees.</p>

<p>I call my emotions busy bees, because they work together to maintain my internal homeâ€”my soul. (Yes, I'm the queen bee in this story). 
They're all different, all essential to the home, working endlessly inside and outside, helping me understand my own soul. Like the queen that I am, I never leave the hive. But I count on my busy bees to come and go, and help me navigate this complex experience. And they do. Much like sensors, they warn me when I should eat, rest, impose a boundary, let it go, and so on. </p>

<p>Honestly, the toughest part is to listen. I'm one of those humans who tends to ignore my emotions and shut them down (it's for protection purposes). </p>
