<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
<p>***** <br />
   Chaotic, funny and beautiful all at once. With Portuguese actress Maria de Medeiros. 
</p>

<h3>La Folie des Grandeurs</h3>
<p>**** <br />
   Louis de Funes, the usual comedic genius. Wardrobe for this is also spot on. 
</p>

<h3>Visages, Villages</h3>
<p>***** <br />
   Agn√®s Varda presents her absolute genius once more. Beautifully wholesome docutale.
